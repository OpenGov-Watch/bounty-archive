## Curator Responsibilities

- Document child bounties implementations
- Prepare quarterly reports
- Share progress with the community to evidence progress made
- Delegate treasury oversight for specialized initiatives

## Recent Developments

A recent referendum proposed reinstating curator addresses for the Polkadot Pioneers Prize (Bounty 10) after curators were automatically unassigned from active bounties due to missed expiry extensions.

## Purpose

The bounty serves as a mechanism for the Polkadot community to delegate treasury oversight to subject matter experts who can manage specialized initiatives focused on attracting and rewarding innovation in the ecosystem.
